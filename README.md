# My SBA 308: Javascript Fundamentals
This is my SBA 308! It takes in data of course information, a list of assignment groups, and a list of submissions
and returns a list of learners by their id, giving the averages of each of the assignments for that learner, and a total average
of all of the assignments as decimals.

# Example Output:
<code>
[
    {
      id: 125,
      avg: 0.985, // (47 + 150) / (50 + 150)
      1: 0.94, // 47 / 50
      2: 1.0 // 150 / 150
    },
    {
      id: 132,
      avg: 0.82, // (39 + 125) / (50 + 150)
      1: 0.78, // 39 / 50
      2: 0.833 // late: (140 - 15) / 150
    }
]
</code>
